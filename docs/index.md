# Project

An AI-native single page PWA built with Next.js 15 and React 19 that reimagines video discovery and sharing through semantic clustering.

## Overview

Project is a Progressive Web Application that transforms how users discover and share videos across platforms. Key features include:

- Minimalist, intuitive interface organized around 'grids' - semantically grouped clusters of videos
- AI-first approach to video organization from YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and other platforms
- Leverages Vercel's ecosystem (NeonDB, Upstash KV, Blob storage) for seamless deployment
- Combines OpenRouter API for advanced search with Google's Gemini API for multimodal understanding
- Thoughtful alternative to endless-scroll 'reels' with semantic organization

## Core Features

- **Semantic Video Clustering**: AI-derived grouping based on color palette, subjects, themes, styles
- **Multimodal Content Understanding**: Gemini API analysis of audio, visual, and textual elements
- **Human-Centered Interface**: Playful interactions powered by Framer Motion
- **Grid Organization System**: Create, discover, and share thematic video collections
- **Structured AI Outputs**: Consistent, predictable user experiences across the application

## Technical Architecture

- Next.js 15 App Router with React 19 Server Components for optimal performance
- PWA implementation with service workers for offline capabilities
- Prisma ORM connected to NeonDB PostgreSQL for structured data
- Upstash KV for high-performance caching and temporary storage
- TypeScript throughout with strict typing for AI response schemas
- API layer using both RESTful and GraphQL approaches for flexible data fetching
