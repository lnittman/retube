# Retube Implementation Memory Bank 05

## Implementation Progress: Hardware-Inspired UI

We've begun transforming the retube application into a hardware-inspired interface that resembles a physical device, similar to Teenage Engineering products or the Rabbit R1. This approach creates a unique and memorable user experience while providing consistent constraints across different screen sizes.

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Created `DeviceFrame` component with hardware-like styling
  - [x] Added physical design elements (screws, buttons, rounded corners)
  - [x] Implemented screen area with subtle scan line effects
  - [x] Created boot sequence animation
- [x] Added supporting components:
  - [x] `DeviceScreen` for content display
  - [x] `DeviceButton` for hardware-style buttons
  - [x] `DeviceDPad` for directional navigation
- [x] Updated home page to use device frame
  - [x] Implemented boot sequence with multiple stages
  - [x] Replaced "semantic clusters" with video preview
  - [x] Added minimal "begin" interface after boot

### Current Status
- The home page now uses the hardware-inspired UI with a boot sequence
- Base components are in place for extending to other pages
- Device frame provides visual consistency with hardware feel

### Next Steps
- [ ] Update the grids listing page to fit within the device frame
- [ ] Redesign navigation as hardware controls
- [ ] Modify the palette interface to match hardware aesthetics
- [ ] Update the prompt interface to resemble a terminal
- [ ] Refine the video player to look like a hardware screen
- [ ] Add button press animations and potentially sound effects
- [ ] Ensure the grid detail and creation flows match the hardware aesthetic

## Technical Approach
- The device frame is a fixed-aspect ratio container that maintains proportions
- CSS used for hardware details (screws, bezel, buttons)
- Framer Motion provides animations for interactive elements and transitions
- SVG patterns create subtle screen effects (scan lines, noise)

## Design References
We continue to draw inspiration from:
- Teenage Engineering OP-1 and Pocket Operator interfaces
- Rabbit R1 minimalist design
- Playdate handheld game console
- Retro computing terminals
- Gameboy and classic handheld devices

## User Experience Considerations
- Focus on making the interface feel tangible and physical
- Ensure controls are intuitive despite the novel presentation
- Use animations that suggest physical movement and feedback
- Balance aesthetics with usability and accessibility

This new direction creates a cohesive, distinctive experience that stands out from typical web applications while embracing the constraints of hardware-inspired design.
