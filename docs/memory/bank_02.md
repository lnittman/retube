## Implementation Progress

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Project documentation review
- [x] Project initialization with Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind v4
- [x] Set up shadcn/ui components 
- [x] Added custom fonts (Tiempos as primary, National as secondary)
- [x] Set up Prisma ORM with database schema
- [x] Created database client utility
- [x] Configured environment variables
- [x] Replaced React Query with SWR for data fetching
- [x] Added framer-motion for fluid transitions
- [x] Completely redesigned app as a minimal, enigmatic single-page experience:
  - [x] Created a minimal dark-themed homepage with animated transitions
  - [x] Redesigned Grid listing page with horizontal navigation
  - [x] Redesigned Grid detail page with horizontal video carousel
  - [x] Removed traditional header and footer for immersive experience
  - [x] Added fluid transitions between all sections
- [x] Implemented all remaining pages with consistent aesthetic:
  - [x] Video detail page with play functionality and related videos
  - [x] User profile page with horizontal section navigation
  - [x] Create Grid form with step-by-step sequence
- [x] Created ThemeProvider component for forced dark mode
- [x] Fixed layout issues with proper viewport metadata

### Current Status
- Project has been completely redesigned with a minimal, mysterious aesthetic
- Single-page application feel with horizontal transitions between sections
- Dark mode only with an emphasis on horizontal flow
- Design inspiration drawn from Teenage Engineering and Rabbit Inc.
- All core pages implemented with consistent design language
- Fluid transitions implemented with framer-motion
- Complete user flow from home → grids → grid detail → video detail
- Form creation with step-by-step process and micro-interactions

### Next Steps
- [ ] Create reusable components:
  - [ ] Extract common modal component
  - [ ] Create pagination indicator component 
  - [ ] Create navigation dots component
- [ ] Set up API routes for data fetching
- [ ] Implement AI integration with Gemini and OpenRouter
- [ ] Set up authentication with minimal UI
- [ ] Add progress animations for video playback
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop for grid organization

## Technical Notes

### Design Philosophy
- Minimalist, enigmatic interface with a focus on horizontal fluidity
- Dark aesthetic with subtle animations and transitions
- Progressive disclosure of information - minimal UI that reveals more on interaction
- Emphasis on spatial transitions rather than traditional page navigation
- Step-by-step forms with micro-feedback
- Limited input fields with generous whitespace

### Page Structure
- Using Next.js App Router but with client-side transitions
- Client Components with framer-motion for animations
- Horizontal flow instead of vertical scrolling
- Modal pattern for detailed information

### Animation Strategy
- Page transitions slide horizontally
- Elements fade in with subtle delays for a staggered appearance
- Minimal loading indicators (simple spinners)
- Micro-interactions on hover and tap
- Scale animations for clickable elements

### UI Components
- Custom-styled minimal inputs and buttons
- Reduced information density
- Focus on visual hierarchy and space
- Consistent navigation patterns (back buttons, info buttons)
- Dot indicators for pagination and progress

### Next Focus
- Extract reusable components to ensure consistency across the application
- Implement API routes for real data integration
- Maintain the mysterious, minimal quality across all interactions
