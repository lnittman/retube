# Retube Implementation Memory Bank 03

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Review project documentation and requirements
- [x] Initialize project with Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind v4
- [x] Set up shadcn/ui components
- [x] Design dark-themed, minimalist interface
- [x] Implement core pages:
  - [x] Home page with horizontal transitions
  - [x] Grids listing page
  - [x] Grid detail page
  - [x] Video detail page
  - [x] Profile page
  - [x] Create grid page
- [x] Fix login flow to connect to grids page
- [x] Add prompt interface to grids page
- [x] Create AI agent framework for processing videos and generating grids
- [x] Add API routes for AI agent

## Current Status
- Project has a minimal and mysterious aesthetic, focusing on horizontal transitions and dark themes
- All core pages are implemented with a consistent design language
- The prompt interface allows users to enter video URLs or text descriptions
- AI agent framework is in place with mock implementations of the processing pipeline
- Environment variables are set up for OpenRouter and Gemini API keys

## Next Steps
- [ ] Implement OpenRouter API integration for the planning and analysis steps
- [ ] Implement Gemini API integration for multimodal analysis
- [ ] Create persistence layer for grids and videos
- [ ] Add authentication with Next Auth
- [ ] Enhance animations and transitions
- [ ] Add actual video processing and embedding

## Technical Notes

### AI Agent Architecture
- Multi-stage processing pipeline:
  1. Planning - Using Claude-3 via OpenRouter to understand the request
  2. Searching - Finding relevant content based on the input
  3. Analyzing - Examining visual and semantic elements using Gemini
  4. Generating - Creating a cohesive grid structure

### User Flow
- Home -> Sign in/continue as guest -> Grids listing
- Grids listing -> Create Grid form
- Grids listing -> AI prompt interface -> Generated Grid
- Grid detail -> Video detail

### UI Components
- PromptInterface - Reusable bottom sheet for AI interactions
- StageIndicator - Visual indicator for processing stages
- Grid cards with hover animations
- Video player with info modal

### Next Focus
- Complete the integration with actual OpenRouter and Gemini APIs
- Implement real data persistence with Prisma
- Add authentication for personalized experiences
