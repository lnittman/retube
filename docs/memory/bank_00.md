# Retube Project Memory Bank

## Project Overview
Retube is an AI-native single page PWA built with Next.js 15 and React 19 that reimagines video discovery and sharing through semantic clustering. The application provides a minimalist, intuitive interface organized around 'grids' - semantically grouped clusters of videos from YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and other platforms.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Framer Motion, shadcn/ui (canary)
- **Data Fetching**: React Query, GraphQL, RESTful APIs
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with NeonDB PostgreSQL
- **Caching**: Upstash KV for high-performance caching
- **Storage**: Vercel Blob Storage for media assets
- **AI**: OpenRouter API, Gemini API

## Core Features
- Semantic Video Clustering: Groups videos based on AI-derived attributes
- Multimodal Content Understanding: Uses Gemini API for comprehensive analysis
- Grid-Based Organization: For creating, discovering, and sharing video collections
- Structured AI Outputs: Ensures consistent user experiences

## Implementation Progress
- [x] Project documentation review
- [ ] Project initialization with latest frameworks
- [ ] Basic project structure setup
- [ ] Core components implementation
- [ ] API integration
- [ ] Database schema setup
- [ ] AI services integration

## Resources
- Project documentation in `/docs` directory
- Framework documentation for Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui

## Notes
- Current task: Initialize project with Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind v4, and shadcn/ui canary
- Focusing on creating minimal, functional foundation before adding more complex features
